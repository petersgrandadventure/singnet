# Conduct Violation Reporting and Grievance Policy

These are the policies followed by SincularityNET's Code of Conduct Committee. It's used when we respond to a reported Code of Conduct violation to make sure we're consistent and fair. This type of document is normally an internal document, but we're publishing it publicly in the interests of transparency.

## The Code of Conduct Committee
All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of Conduct Committee ("the committee").

The SingularityNET Foundation's Board of Directors ("the board") will establish this committee, comprised of at least three members. One member will be designated chair of the group and will be responsible for all reports back to the board. The board will review membership on a regular basis.

## How the committee will respond to reports
When a report is sent to the committee at least one member will immediately reply to the report to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 24 hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you report it to the SingularityNET Foundation by emailing conduct@singularitynet.io. All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve the Code of Conduct and the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?
If a report doesn't contain enough information, the committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The committee is empowered to act on the DSF's behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events.

The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* what happened
* whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
* who, if anyone, was the bad actor
* whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's physical safety

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the group's deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. IRC transcripts, email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).

The working group should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the group will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.

# Acting Unilaterally
If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment on our open social media channels), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any working group member may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools available to the working group, including bans and blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the working group may -- and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the SingularityNET Foundation.

In situations where an individual group member acts unilaterally, they must report their actions to the working group for review within 24 hours.

## Resolutions
The working group must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
* A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
* An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from a mailing list or IRC). The group chair will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all SingularityNET spaces (mailing lists, Telegram or Slack Channels, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new SingularityNET fora, or otherwise maintained.
* A request for a public or private apology. The chair will deliver this request. The group may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership on a mailing list.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the working group will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The working group will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the working group is not required to act on this feedback.

Finally the working group will make a report for the SingularityNET Foundation board (as well as the SingularityNET community team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban).

The working group will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will be made by the SingularityNET Foundation board.

## Conflicts of Interest
In the event of any conflict of interest a working group member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
