All of us in the SingularitNET Community are working very hard to build an amazing global complex software system with many 
moving parts. So we really appreciate your help reporting issues you encounter.

Please consider supplying the following information with any issue reports:

## Type of Issue
 - **Bug** - Does the software do something it shouldn't? Or not do something it is expected to do?

 - **Documentation Correction** - Is the documentation out of date? Do the instructions work for you on your machine?

 - **Documentation Clarification** - Is something confusing or incomplete? Did you have to Google to understand it?

 - **Enhancement Request** - Is there something not already in our public plans that will make SingularityNET better?

## Bug Reports
Bugs are very sensitive to the specific software you are using. When possible please provide specifics about::

 - The OS and hardware your are using including version numbers of relevant software.
 - The specific browser you are using if it is a web interface that exhibits the problem.
 - Installed software packages (Python, Node, C++ where applicable)

Also, have pity on the programmers. It may be obvious to you how to reproduce the problems but sometimes it is the
little things that matter. If you are going to the trouble of reporting an issue, please spend the additional time
to give us enough information so the devs can find the problem you have and fix it.

Thank you.
